Hey, my name is Anas Alqoyyum. I'm a Software Engineer mostly focuses on Frontend Engineer in which primarily revolves around `React` and `TypeScript`. Other than
Frontend stuff, I also have a bit of experience in `Golang`. To be honest, I realize that I'm a bit unexposed or uneducated to a Compiled Languages, only as far as
using it during my time as a student in University. It makes me feel a bit inferior and that's the primary reason why I decided to learn `Golang`
(and it's been fun), hopefully in the near-future `Golang` became something that I would use as much as `TypeScript`.

Even though my final project is revolving around Machine Learning titled **`"YOLOv4 Algorithm Implementation Based on Darknet and Optical Character Recognition on Vehicle License Plate Detection"`**. Even though it was good but I felt that it wasn't good enough and I always felt like that my effort was lacking and thinking back I could do better but what done is done. BUT, I still have a
somewhat small interest in that field who knows maybe when I'm bored with Frontend stuff I'll move to that field. The future is unknown and filled with many possibilities.

Sometimes I share my expertise as a robotic instructor for extracurricular activity in a school. It's not full-time, only helping here and there when its needed.

My technical skills:

- HTML - CSS: SASS, CSS-in-JS (I.e. `Styled Components`), and utility-first CSS (I.e. `Tailwind`)
- Javascript - TypeScript: React and Node.js (Primarily `TypeScript`)
- Native/Desktop: Electron
- Web frameworks: Next.js, Remix, Storybook, Laravel
- Bundlers: Webpack, Vite, esbuild (Leaning to `Vite` & `esbuild` nowadays)
- Testing: Jest, Cypress, Vitest
- Compiled languages: Golang
- Git, CI/CD, and static site generators (I.e. `Astro`)

On fun side of things, I'm self-diagnosed with a really bad Rhythm Games addiction (only play rhythm games) mostly [SDVX](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/eacsdvx/vi/index.html), [IIDX](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/eac2dx/infinitas/), [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/). Perhaps the reason why I'm addicted is because it is fun and rewarding. Also sometimes I did create some custom chart for those games in my free-time
